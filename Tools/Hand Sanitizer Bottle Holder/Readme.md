# Hand Sanitizer Magnet Mount   
This is a magnet mount to hold small hand sanitizer bottles available from Dr. Bronner or Trader Joe's (and other places). We use ours in an oler vehicle with exposed metal and the bottle hangs on even on bumpy roads!

### Parts 
- 3D Printed Handles TPU (other plastics may work, but may not fit without modifications to the design)
- 13mm diameter by 6mm thick neodynium magnet
- [Dr. Bronner Organic Hand Sanitizer (2oz bottle)](https://shop.drbronner.com/collections/hand-sanitizer/products/lavender-organic-hand-sanitizer)

### Print Settings 
Printed with enough walls to make the design solid throughout.
